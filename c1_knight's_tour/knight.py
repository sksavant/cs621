# This program tries to solve the knight's tour problem
# 
# Problem Statement: 
# In a chessboard of size 8X8 , given a position of a knight, find a tour 
# which will go to each of the squares exactly once.
# 
# Implementation:
# There are known solutions for the knight's tour using 
# *Divide and Conquer algorithms
# *Neural Networks :
# *Heurestic methods : Warnsdorff's rule
# 
# This program implements the Warnsdorff's rule using tie-breaking techniques
# devised by Pohl?/ (new heurestic?)
