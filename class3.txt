Logic consists of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.
Knowledge representation takes care of information.
According to wiki, Reasoning is the capacity to make sense of things , establish/verify facts and to change/justify practices.
Reasoning includes Deductions and Inductions/Learning/Hypothesis formulation (like Pattern Recognition) (Everything starts with assumptions)
Logic is a Formal Language i.e, one with a well-defined syntax and semantics.

There are various types of logics.

Propositional Logic:

Syntax. Any word which is part of formal language is a well-formed formula  Wff is syntactically correct.
Semantics refers to the meaning of the formulas. A language has is semantic if it formulas are clean,unique, well-defined.

A Wff can be written in a tree form with variables as leaves and operations as internal nodes
Eg : !(p->q)^r is written as 
        ^
    !       r
    ->
p       q

A custom formula can have more than 2 leaves, Eg. majority.

BDD (Binary Decision Diagrams)
It is a datastructure used to represent a Boolean function.
This represents the function as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
The no. of branches in the BDD can be reduces by suitably selecting what to write first.

#Eg : Define a function and implement as BDD. one with 20 nodes and other with 100 nodes.
Hint: Use the fact that some operators are assymetric. for eg. implication.


CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)
In this form as formula is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals. Similar to POS form (product of sum)

Satisfiability problem:
Given a wff, determine whether it is satisfiable (Also try to give the input for the satisfiability)
It's an NP-Complete problem.

#For exiercise: Think for 3 weeks then see algorithm (DPLL)
#Exercise:
#Given a cnf form of formula with format
# <literals> <lines>
# n0 n2 n3
# .. .. ..
# .. .. .. .. .. ..
#
#
# .. .. .. ..<lastline>
#
#Q: Make an intelligent program which tests for the satisfiability.


First Order Logic :
Predicates and Quantifiers.
There are logical symbols and non-logical(varying meaning)
Logical symbols include ForAll ThereExists, logical connectives parentheses, other punctiations, variables, equality symbol
Every non-logical symbols is a predicate symbol or a function symbol.

Next class we'll talk about uncertain knowledge.
