There are 4 boxes and label on them
1 : not here
2 : in 3
3 : in 4
4 : 2 is lying
Only one of the label is true others are false.
If both 2 and 4 are false, that means
-not in 3 and -2 is saying truth (in 3)
Not feasible
say 4 is true, others false. implies 
-in 1 -not in 3 -not in 4 -2 is lying
feasible! => It's in 1 and 4 is saying truth.
